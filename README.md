# 🐦 PigeonSec Blocklists

Two blocklists, freshly pecked, cleaned, and de-wormed by a flock of cyber-pigeons:

- **🦠 bad.txt** — malware, phishing, C2, shady junk.
  If it tries to steal your crumbs, it’s in here.
- **💩 annoying.txt** — trackers, miners, pop-up hoarders, and other digital pigeons.  

Both are perfect snacks for **Pi-hole**, **AdGuard Home**, or any DNS blocker that eats plain text.

## How they’re made

These aren’t random breadcrumbs — they’re crafted by our in-house super-bird:  
👉 [**Magpie**](https://github.com/PigeonSec/magpie)

Magpie zooms around the internet,  
grabbing dozens of blocklists, validating every domain,  
and squashing duplicates faster than a pigeon dodging traffic.

Built in pure Go, with shiny progress bars because pigeons love flair. 🪶


Made with crumbs, caffeine, and questionable bird noises by PigeonSec.

"Grrrrrruuuuuhhhh!!!!" PigeeeooonnSeeeeeec!!!
