# 🐦 PigeonSec Blocklists

Two blocklists, freshly pecked, cleaned, and de-wormed by a flock of cyber-pigeons:

| File | Description | Raw Link |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **🦠 `bad.txt`** | Malware, phishing, C2s, and other crumb-stealing nasties. | [🔗 View Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PigeonSec/blocklists/refs/heads/main/bad.txt) |
| **💩 `annoying.txt`** | Trackers, miners, pop-ups, and other digital pigeons. | [🔗 View Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PigeonSec/blocklists/refs/heads/main/annoying.txt) |


Both are perfect snacks for **Pi-hole**, **AdGuard Home**, or any DNS blocker that eats plain text.

## How they’re made

These aren’t random breadcrumbs — they’re crafted by our in-house super-bird:  
👉 [**Magpie**](https://github.com/PigeonSec/magpie)

Magpie zooms around the internet,  
grabbing dozens of blocklists, validating every domain,  
and squashing duplicates faster than a pigeon dodging traffic.

Built in pure Go, with shiny progress bars because pigeons love flair. 🪶


Made with crumbs, caffeine, and questionable bird noises by PigeonSec.

"Grrrrrruuuuuhhhh!!!!" PigeeeooonnSeeeeeec!!!
